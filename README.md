# Movie-Recommendation-System-Project

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a personalized movie recommendation system built to enhance user engagement by providing tailored movie suggestions. By analyzing data from 5,000 English-language movies, the system utilizes various techniques to deliver recommendations that resonate with individual user preferences. 

## Project Background
In the age of streaming services, the abundance of available content can be overwhelming for users. This project seeks to address the challenge of helping users discover movies that align with their tastes and preferences, ultimately improving their viewing experience and encouraging further engagement.

## Goals
- To develop a recommendation engine that can suggest movies based on user-selected content.
- To utilize effective data processing and analysis techniques to ensure accuracy in recommendations.
- To create an intuitive interface that allows users to explore movie recommendations seamlessly.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Collected a dataset featuring 5,000 English movies, which includes various attributes such as:
  - Title
  - Genre
  - Description
  - Release Year
  - Directors
  - Cast
  - Ratings

### 2. Data Cleaning
- The dataset underwent a cleansing process to ensure accuracy and consistency:
  - Removal of duplicate entries.
  - Handling of missing values.
  - Standardization of textual data formats.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Tag Creation:** 
  - Merged multiple textual columns (e.g., genre, description, actors, directors) into a single comprehensive tag for each movie. This allows the system to consider various aspects of the movie when making recommendations.
  
- **Vectorization:**
  - Implemented the Bag of Words technique to convert textual data into numerical vectors. This representation allows for easier computation of similarity between movies.

### 4. Similarity Calculation
- **Cosine Similarity:**
  - Calculated a cosine similarity matrix to evaluate how similar each movie is to every other movie based on their respective tags. This metric enables the recommendation system to find movies that share attributes with those selected by users.

### 5. Recommendation Engine
- Developed an algorithm that utilizes the cosine similarity scores to recommend movies. When a user selects a movie, the system identifies the most similar movies based on the pre-computed similarity matrix.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Users can receive movie suggestions based on their selected titles.
- **User Interface:** Designed for ease of use, allowing users to navigate through recommendations effortlessly.
- **Data Visualization:** Optional graphical representation of the recommended movies for enhanced interaction.
- **Expandable Data Set:** Future-proofed to allow for the addition of more movies or user ratings to improve recommendations over time.
